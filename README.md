The MainLoop a Alderson loop , it's something close to a infinity loop but with a MainLoop.run() and MainLoop.quit() method's.

The MainLoop make it work and take a adaptive sleep time for impose a global Frame Rate.

That loop , should be a low power consumption, that was our target for the beginning.

* Alderson loop with run and quit method's
* Don't use 100% of CPU Time
* Frame Per Second with adaptive limitation
* Limitation will be apply with a knee (percentage) it depend of the Event list size

To Do
-----
* A Event Bus
* The Event list size should control interact with Frame Rate Limitation
